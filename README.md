# Ammatias `Homelab`


**Hey, there!**


This Repository **Homelab** contains all my homelab documentation files. Here you'll find notes, setups, and configurations for infrastructure, applications, networking, and more.

> :warning: Be aware, products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this wonâ€™t always be the case.


## Contribution

As this is my personal Homelab documentation, I don't accept any contributions. But feel free to fork this repository and use it for your own documentation.
